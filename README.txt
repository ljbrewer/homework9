## Description

    
    ### Title: README.md file generator

    ### Motivation: To alleviate the stress in creating the readme file. One has to be created for each project we complete. This way we not need to worry about the syntax for the file.

    ### Why was this application created: I built this program to make it easier to create the readme file.

    ### Issues: I do not have to worry about the small characters that are usually needed in the file.

    ### What was Learned: I learned that one commas out of place can derail the whole program.

    ### What Standsout in this program: This application is run from the command line and not in the browser.

    ### Challenges that were faced: I had a difficulty getting the promise to recognize the response from the user.  I also had issues getting it to write the new reqdme file to the disk.

    ### New Features: I would like to include a grammar checker, so that errors could be addressed while writing the information.
        
    ## Intallation: To run this program you will need to install npm, the inquirer module, and the utils module. Once these have been installed be sure to create a folder called **.gitignore** so that you do not upload all the node_modules to your repository.
    
    ## Usage: Changed to the directory where the node and index.js files are located, then on the command line type: node index.js and hit the enter key. Then answer the questions as it prompts you. Once you've answered all the questions, the program will create your readme file in the same directory.
