## Description

     README.md file generator..
 Next item is?
     To setup a way to generate the README file without having to worry about the syntax..

     To alleviate the stress in creating this file. We have to create one with each of our projects..

     I not have to worry about the syntax for the file..

     Small characters can be the difference between the program working or failing..

     This project is a command line program somewhat similar to the old DOS programs we used to write..

     Getting it to create the actual file..     I would like to include a grammar checking in the future..

     homework9/index.js.
